# Empatia
Support system for decision making in air quality management

## Requirements
 - Python >= 3.7.0
 - GRASS GIS >= 7.6
 - Any flavour of Conda. We recommend [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
 - A version Docker on your OS


## Local Set up

In order to provide environment variables to the project it is needed a `.env` file in the root of the project.
Copy the `.env.template` as `.env` and replace the placeholders with real values.

```
$ cp .env.template .env
```

```
$ export $(xargs < .env)
```

Create a .netrc file in your home directory.
```
$ cd $HOME
```

```
$ touch .netrc
```

```
$ echo "machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login <uid> password <password>" >> .netrc
```
where `<uid>` is your user name and `<password>` is your Earthdata Login password without the brackets.

```
chmod 0600 .netrc 
```

Generate the Conda environment and install all the dependencies.
```
$ conda create -n <environment name> python=3.7
```

```
$ conda activate <environment name>
```

```
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Also, you can install common tools running the following script:
```
./commands/install_common_tools.sh
```

Once your Git Repository was set, install the local hooks.
- Install pre-commit
```
$ pre-commit install
```

- Add pre-push hook
```
$ touch .git/hooks/pre-push;echo "pytest" > .git/hooks/pre-push; chmod a+x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

## Dockerized App

- Build image
```
$ ./commands/build.sh --tag <tag_name>
```

- Create container
```
$ docker run --name <container_name> --env-file .env-docker -it empatia:<tag_name> /bin/bash
```

- Run container
```
$ docker start <container_name>
```

- Enter to container
```
$ docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```

 - Create a .netrc file in home directory.
```
$ cd
```

```
$ touch .netrc
```

```
$ echo "machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login <uid> password <password> >> .netrc"
```
where `<uid>` is your user name and `<password>` is your Earthdata Login password without the brackets.

```
chmod 0600 .netrc
```

## CLIs

```
$ empatia run_viirs_etl
```

It runs pipeline to get the mean of April, May and June of the product `VNP46A1`.

```
$ empatia compute_daily_products
```

It runs pipeline to get  the following daily products:
* PM10 and QA_AOD per sensor orbit
* ICA PM10

for the current date and tries to get these missing products for previous days.

```
$ empatia compute_monthly_products --ndays 30
```

It runs pipeline to get the following monthly statisticians:
* Mean
* Standar Desviation
* N

from the given predictions for the month of: `current date - ndays`

```
$ empatia clean_all --ndays 60
```

It cleans GRASS DB and removes obsolete files/folder created before `current date - ndays`

```
$ empatia run_training
```

It runs PM1O model training


## How to set custom color palletes

* If you want to change the PM10 color pallete, you need to change the following file: `empatia/data/utils/pm10_color_rules.txt`.
This file looks like:
```
    50 26:150:65
    75 166:217:106
    100 255:255:192
    125 253:174:97
    150 215:25:28
```
where the first column is the PM10 value and the second column is the RGB color.


* If you want to change the ICA color pallete, you need to change the following file: `empatia/data/utils/ica_color_rules.txt`.
This file looks like:
```
    1 0:228:0
    2 255:255:0
    3 255:126:0
    4 255:0:0
    5 143:63:151
    6 126:0:35
```
where the first column is the ICA value and the second column is the RGB color. These definitions are taken from US Environmental Protection Agency (2018), Technical Assistance Document for the Reporting of Daily Air Quality â€“ the Air Quality Index (AQI), EPA-454/B-18-007 (https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf).
